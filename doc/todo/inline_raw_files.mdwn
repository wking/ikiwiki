summary
=======

Extend inlining to handle raw files (files with unrecognized extensions).

Also raise an error in IkiWiki::pagetype($file) if $file is blank, which avoids trying to do much with missing files, etc.

I've included this patch (and some other adjustments) in my [branch] of the IkiWiki Git repository.  I'm using the new code in my [blog][].
