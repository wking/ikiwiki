I took my own advice and rewrote the dump plugin so that it uses a template.  A sample template has been added to my [[Dropbox|http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11256359/dump.tmpl]].

### Issues:

* Dumps appear at the end of the page rather than where the directive occurs.
* For some reason I haven't yet figured out, dumps don't appear in page previews.
* I haven't tested inlined content and the dump plugin.
