I have a second plugin that adds a directive 'dump', and dumps all sorts of information (env variables and template variables) about a page into the end of the page. It's cheesy, but it's available in my [[Dropbox|http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11256359/dump.pm]] as well as the Asciidoc plugin.

### Issues
* It really ought to use some kind of template instead of HTML. In fact, it ought to embed its information in template variables of some kind rather than stuffing it into the end of the page.
