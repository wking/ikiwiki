how can I create a link to an image which is part of the wiki, without having it inserted in my page?

I tought this:

    \[[look at this|img/lolcat.png]] 

would work, but it doesn't.

Any hints? --[[jerojasro]]

	return htmllink($params{page}, $params{destpage}, $params{"img"},
	    linktext => $params{text},
	    noimageinline => 1);
